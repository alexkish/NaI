# NaI
GEANT4 simulation of paired NaI detectors for coincidence measurements and signal stability studies

Studied various sizes of the detectors and their type (with and without a well), optimized the configuration and shielding for the experimental requirements.
The experimental setup reqlized based on these Monte-Carlo studies is described in:
